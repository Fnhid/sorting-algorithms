# 🏗️ **Sorting Algorithms Playground** 🚧

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Playground**! Here, you'll find a variety of sorting algorithms in action. Whether you're optimizing performance or experimenting with different sorts, this project has you covered. 💻✨

---

🚧 **This project is still under construction!** New features and sorting algorithms are actively being added. Stay tuned for updates! 🚧

## ⚙️ **Configuration Options**

- **Array Size & Number**:  
  Customize the size of arrays by modifying `ARRAY_SIZE` and `MAX_NUMBER` in **`sort.h`**.  
  *💡 Adjust these to test your sorting algorithms on arrays of different sizes!*

- **Toggle Array Printing**:  
  Turn the array-printing feature on or off by changing the value of `PRINT_ARRAY` in **`sort.h`**.  
  *👀 Useful when debugging or viewing array transformations!*

- **Select Sorting Algorithms**:  
  Choose which sorting algorithms to execute by modifying `isSortingEnabled` in **`main.cpp`**.  
  *🔀 Easily enable or disable specific sorts with this simple switch.*

## 🛠️ **How to Build**

**Build the project**:
```bash
make
```

**Remove generated files**:
```bash
make clean
```

**Rebuild** (use this when the output file is already built and only header files have changed):
```bash
make rebuild
```
